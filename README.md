# Optimal Energy Management System for Smart Residential Buildings

## Overview
This project develops a comprehensive framework for optimizing energy use in residential buildings. By integrating renewable energy sources (RES), energy storage systems (ESS), and advanced load scheduling techniques, the project aims to minimize energy costs, enhance energy independence, and support sustainability goals.

## Features
- **Renewable Energy Integration**
  - Supports solar PV, wind energy, and other renewable sources.
  - Efficient energy flow management between renewables, the grid, and local storage.
- **Battery Energy Storage Optimization**
  - Optimizes charging and discharging schedules to extend battery life and minimize degradation costs.
  - Enhances peak shaving and load balancing capabilities.
- **Smart Load Scheduling**
  - Dynamic scheduling based on time-of-use and real-time pricing.
  - Prioritizes critical loads during high-demand periods.
- **Sustainability**
  - Reduces dependence on fossil fuels.
  - Promotes energy self-sufficiency for residential buildings.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mrpooriyakh/Gr1-BRenewableEnerg.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
